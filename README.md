# Leish_SIR
SIR and multinomial logistic regression modeling approaches for Human VL historical data.

Simulated data (SIR_generated_simulation.RData) are available to run these models (Simulation_study_multinomial_vs_SIR_model_fitting.R)

The two Simulation_Model_Fit_Assessment files allow the user to assess model fit and calculate BFs using the algorithm proposed in the 
paper "Bayesian compartmental model for an infectious disease with dynamic states of infection" (currently in revision)
